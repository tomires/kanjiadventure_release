# Kanji Adventure (battle prototype)

Here you will find releases for an early build of Kanji Adventure, an edutainment turn-based RPG game designed to teach you Japanese in an entertaining way. The current alpha release includes a **demonstration of the battle system**, which is mainly designed to illustrate the learning element.

As I do not possess knowledge about the Japanese skill of yours, I will presume that you have no previous experience. As such I have intentionally made combat easier by increasing health of your character and doubling the time that is available for answering queries. Inside this repository (.zip) you can also find a **helpful cheat sheet** to get you up to speed. You can also find a text version of the cheat sheet at the end of this document.

## Controls

* keyboard - writing kana in query mode
* enter - confirm query
* ←↑↓→ - optional camera control
* mouse *or compatible pointing device* - movement, spell casting

## Spells
You have three spells at your disposal. You can use one per turn. *Choose wisely!*

1. **Whirl** - a powerful spell that can only be used on nearby enemies

2. **Precision Shot** - a long range spell that deals moderate damage

3. **Gust** - an *area-of-effect* spell that deals moderate damage to multiple enemies at a time

## Learning element
Each time a spell is cast, the player will be asked to transcribe kanji character displayed to kana using their keyboard. Damage dealt by the spell depends on time spent answering the query.
