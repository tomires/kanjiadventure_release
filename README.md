# Kanji Adventure (exploration demo)

Here you will find releases for an early build of Kanji Adventure, an edutainment turn-based RPG game designed to teach you Japanese in an entertaining way. The current alpha release includes a **demonstration of the exploration system**, which features a progressive learning system, quests, items and more.

As I do not possess knowledge about the Japanese skill of yours, I will presume that you have no previous experience. As such I have prepared a cheatsheet including a list of all kanji used within the current build of the game. You can find it at the end of this document.

## Requirements

The game requires a minimum resolution of 1920x1080. If the user is running Windows 10, they need to turn off scaling for the game to display properly.

## Controls

* keyboard - writing kana in query mode
* enter - confirm query
* ←↑↓→ - optional camera control (battle only)
* mouse *or compatible pointing device* - everything else

## Quests
Try your hand at seven unique quests available in this release. You will hunt rabbits, participate in a scavenger hunt, collect fruit and more.

## Spells
You have four spells at your disposal, that you can mix and match during each turn.

1. **Whirl** - a powerful spell that can only be used on nearby enemies

2. **Precision Shot** - a long range spell that deals moderate damage

3. **Wind Gust** - a powerful *area-of-effect* spell that deals damage to multiple enemies at a time

4. **Fiery Arrow** - a directional *area-of-effect* spell that deals moderate damage to enemies located in a straight line between you and your target

In addition to these four spells, you also have an option to use consumable items during the battle portion of the game in order to replenish health.

## Learning element
Each time a spell is cast, the player will be asked to transcribe kanji character displayed to kana using their keyboard. Damage dealt by the spell depends on time spent answering the query. The player obtains a new kanji character every time they level up.

## Cheat sheet
The following table lists all possible query phrases that can be encountered, their pronunciation in hiragana as well as approximations of romaji transcriptions. If the player is not familiar with hiragana, they can enter these letter by letter.
